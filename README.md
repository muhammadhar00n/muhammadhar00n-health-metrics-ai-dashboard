a. Codebase Documentation
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

For Windows:

python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application:
For running the integration script:

python data_integration/main.py

open another cmd dont close previos one because api is running through it and make sure initially you are in the repository directory health-metrics-ai-dashboard.
after opening another cmd activate environemnt in new cmd 
For Windows:

python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

then cd aggregation

uvicorn aggregate_insights:app --reload --port 9000 #to run the aggregate layer

for running the web app ui create open another cmd make sure initially you are in the repository directory health-metrics-ai-dashboard
then follow previous step to activate the env and cd to aggregation and then hit the command streamlit run dashboard.py 

#see in the video.

AI Agents Explanation:
Fitness Agent: Analyzes health data (steps, calories, heart rate) using machine learning to assess fitness and predict outcomes.

Data Integration Agent: Integrates and processes health data from various sources (APIs, device data) into a unified dataset for further analysis.

Analysis Logic: Each agent focuses on specific tasks (e.g., fitness analysis, data collection), but they communicate to offer comprehensive insights.

Design Documentation:
Modular Agent Structure:

Fitness Agent: Analyzes fitness data using machine learning models for insights.
Data Integration Agent: Collects, processes, and standardizes data for use by other agents.
Challenges and Solutions:

Challenges:
Integrating diverse data from multiple sources.
Limited labeled data for fitness predictions.
Solutions:
Data cleaning techniques to standardize inputs.
Reinforcement learning to improve agent accuracy.
Diagrams:

Agent Workflow: Diagrams showing communication flow between agents (e.g., Data Integration → Fitness Agent → User Interface).
System Architecture: High-level overview with external APIs, agents, and user interfaces.
